## Tumer_detection
Here i have developed deep learning model with the help of CNN and VGG-16 using imagenet

The Brain Scan Tumor Classification is a Deep learning project created by myself .We can give photos into the model, and get a prediction result. For this project, we are using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network and VGG-16  to classify 2D MRI brain scan images as tumorous or non-tumorous. Our model was built with Tensorflow, utilizing the Keras API. Our model's input is composed of standardized 240x240x1 single-channel image arrays. After training, an image passed to the model will produce a prediction of either 1 (tumorous) or 0 (non-tumorous).
